## Contributing

First of all, thank you for considering to contribute to this project. Here are a few hints that will help you get
started.

### Install Composer

We use Composer to manage dependencies.

Follow the [installation instructions](https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/installation.html#installation.composer)
to perform a local or global install.

Once Composer is ready run `php composer.phar install` and all dependencies will be downloaded. You are now ready to go!
